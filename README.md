# crm-replica-collab
CRM Group Project

Group project collaboration between Connor, Ashmika, Chad, and Joseph.

We built a replica of the Double Tap CRM pages that were assigned to us. 
We each took on a different page of the assignment and helped each other along the way.

Contributions were as follows:

*Connor- sign_up.html and sign_up.css (possibly still listed as main.css), and div.body1 section in landingpage.html
*Ashmika- signin.html and signin.css and researching how to pull different icons for everyone's pages in the project.
*Chad- landingpage.html and landingpage.css
*Joseph- index.html and crm.css

Additionally, we all helped each other with different errors and formatting issues we ran into.

Languages:
We used HTML and CSS for this project.
